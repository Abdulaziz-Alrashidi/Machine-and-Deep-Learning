Multilayer Perceptron from Scratch

This project implements a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) from scratch using Python, NumPy, and pure mathematical operations.

This notebook includes:

- The math and code for forward propagation

- Backward propagation

- Updating the parameters using gradient descent

- Model training and evaluation

Note: The notebook contains long outputs. It is recommended to view it in a Jupyter Notebook environment, which allows scrolling or collapsible outputs for easier navigation.
